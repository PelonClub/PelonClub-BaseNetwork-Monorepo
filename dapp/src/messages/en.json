If the vault already has 100,000 PELON and 100,000 CALDERO in circulation, depositing 10,000 PELON would give you approximately 10,000 CALDERO as well, maintaining the proportion."

Of the 300 PELON fee, 150 goes to the fee wallet and 150 remains in the vault, increasing the value per share for all remaining holders."

If someone withdraws 10,000 PELON paying 300 in fees (150 to vault), the vault now has 90,150 PELON and 90,000 CALDERO. The new rate is 1.00167:1, meaning each CALDERO is now worth more PELON. All holders benefit from this increase."

          "title": "Potential Yield Calculations",
          "description": "If the vault processes frequent withdrawals, the 50% of fees that remain in the vault can generate significant compound yield. For example, if 1,000,000 PELON is withdrawn in a month with 3% fees, 15,000 PELON goes to the vault (50% of 30,000). This growth benefits all holders proportionally to their shares."
