# The Sigmoid Bonding Curve: Your Guide to Buying PELON Tokens

## Why Timing Matters

Imagine you're buying concert tickets. The first few people get the best seats at the lowest price. As more tickets sell, prices go up. That's exactly how our token sale works—except instead of seats, you're getting PELON tokens, and the price changes automatically based on how many tokens have been sold.

**Here's the thing:** Every token purchase makes the next one slightly more expensive. The earlier you buy, the more tokens you get for your USDC. It's that simple.

## What is a Bonding Curve?

Think of a bonding curve like a vending machine that gets more expensive as it runs out of items. When the machine is full (no tokens sold), prices are at their lowest. As people buy tokens, the machine has fewer left, so it charges more.

Our bonding curve uses a special mathematical shape called a "sigmoid curve." This means the price increases smoothly—not in sudden jumps—as more tokens are sold. It starts super cheap and gradually gets more expensive until it reaches the maximum price.

## How the Sigmoid Curve Works

The price of PELON tokens follows a smooth curve that looks like an "S" when you graph it:

- **At the start (0 tokens sold):** Price is at its absolute minimum
- **As tokens sell:** Price increases gradually and smoothly
- **At the midpoint (100B tokens sold):** Price is about halfway between minimum and maximum
- **Near the end (200B tokens sold):** Price reaches its maximum

The beauty of this system? There are no surprises. The price is calculated automatically based on exactly how many tokens have been sold. You can always check the current price before buying.

## Price Tiers: When to Buy

We've divided the sale into four tiers based on how many tokens have been sold. Each tier represents a different phase of the sale, and the price difference between tiers can be significant.

### Tier 1: Early Bird (0 - 20B tokens sold)

**Price Range:** 0.000003 - 0.00001 USDC per PELON

This is the absolute best time to buy. You're getting in at the ground floor. At this tier, 1 USDC gets you approximately 333,333 to 100,000 PELON tokens.

**Example Purchase:**
- You spend: 100 USDC
- You receive: ~10,000,000 to ~33,333,333 PELON tokens
- Why it matters: This is the cheapest price you'll ever see. Period.

### Tier 2: Early Adopter (20B - 50B tokens sold)

**Price Range:** ~0.00001 - 0.00005 USDC per PELON

Still an excellent entry point. The price has increased, but you're still getting a fantastic deal. At this tier, 1 USDC gets you approximately 20,000 to 100,000 PELON tokens.

**Example Purchase:**
- You spend: 100 USDC
- You receive: ~2,000,000 to ~10,000,000 PELON tokens
- Why it matters: You're still early, but the window is closing. Prices are rising.

### Tier 3: Growth Phase (50B - 100B tokens sold)

**Price Range:** ~0.00005 - 0.001 USDC per PELON

The sale is gaining momentum. Prices are noticeably higher, but there's still value to be found. At this tier, 1 USDC gets you approximately 1,000 to 20,000 PELON tokens.

**Example Purchase:**
- You spend: 100 USDC
- You receive: ~100,000 to ~2,000,000 PELON tokens
- Why it matters: The early bird advantage is mostly gone. You're paying 3-30x more than Tier 1 buyers.

### Tier 4: Maturity (100B - 200B tokens sold)

**Price Range:** ~0.001 - 0.01 USDC per PELON

The final phase. Prices are at their highest, approaching the maximum. At this tier, 1 USDC gets you approximately 100 to 1,000 PELON tokens.

**Example Purchase:**
- You spend: 100 USDC
- You receive: ~10,000 to ~100,000 PELON tokens
- Why it matters: You're paying 10-300x more than Tier 1 buyers. The opportunity cost of waiting is massive.

## Real-World Comparison: Early vs Late Buyers

Let's say you want to buy $1,000 worth of PELON tokens. Here's what you'd get depending on when you buy:

| When You Buy | Tokens Sold | Price per PELON | Tokens You Get | Difference from Tier 1 |
|--------------|-------------|-----------------|----------------|------------------------|
| **Tier 1 (Early Bird)** | 5B | 0.000003 USDC | ~333,333,333 PELON | Baseline |
| **Tier 2 (Early Adopter)** | 35B | 0.00002 USDC | ~50,000,000 PELON | 6.7x fewer tokens |
| **Tier 3 (Growth Phase)** | 75B | 0.0003 USDC | ~3,333,333 PELON | 100x fewer tokens |
| **Tier 4 (Maturity)** | 150B | 0.005 USDC | ~200,000 PELON | 1,666x fewer tokens |

**The math doesn't lie:** Waiting costs you. A lot.

## Why Buy Early? The Numbers Don't Lie

Let's break down what happens if you wait:

**Scenario 1: You buy 100 USDC worth in Tier 1**
- You get: ~33,333,333 PELON tokens
- If price goes to 0.01 USDC: Your tokens are worth ~333,333 USDC
- Profit: ~333,233 USDC (333,133% gain)

**Scenario 2: You wait and buy 100 USDC worth in Tier 4**
- You get: ~10,000 PELON tokens
- If price goes to 0.01 USDC: Your tokens are worth ~100 USDC
- Profit: ~0 USDC (you broke even)

Same investment. Completely different outcome. The difference? **Timing.**

## How to Buy: Step-by-Step

1. **Connect your wallet** to the Pelon Club platform
2. **Check the current price** - You'll see exactly how many tokens you'll get
3. **Enter your USDC amount** - Minimum purchase amounts apply
4. **Approve the transaction** - Your wallet will ask for confirmation
5. **Receive your PELON tokens** - They appear in your wallet immediately

**Important Limits:**
- Maximum per wallet: 20B PELON tokens (you can make multiple purchases up to this limit)
- Total sale limit: 200B PELON tokens (once this is reached, the sale ends)
- Payment method: USDC only

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How is the price calculated?

The price uses a mathematical formula called a sigmoid curve. It automatically adjusts based on how many tokens have been sold. The more tokens sold, the higher the price. You can always check the current price on the platform before buying.

### Can the price go down?

No. The bonding curve only moves in one direction: up. Once tokens are sold, the price for remaining tokens increases. This protects early buyers and ensures fair distribution.

### What happens when all 200B tokens are sold?

Once 200B tokens are sold, the sale ends. The price will have reached its maximum (0.01 USDC per PELON). After that, tokens will be available on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) where prices will be determined by market supply and demand.

### Can I buy more than once?

Yes! You can make multiple purchases as long as your total doesn't exceed 20B PELON tokens per wallet. Each purchase will be at the current price at that moment.

### What if I want to buy more than 20B tokens?

The 20B token limit per wallet is designed to prevent whale accumulation and ensure fair distribution. If you need more tokens, you'll need to use additional wallets, though we encourage fair participation.

### Is there a minimum purchase amount?

Yes, there are minimum purchase amounts to prevent spam transactions. Check the platform for current minimums.

### Can I see how many tokens have been sold?

Yes! The platform displays real-time information about:
- Total tokens sold
- Current price
- Tokens remaining
- Your purchase history

### What happens to unsold tokens?

If not all 200B tokens are sold, the remaining tokens will be handled according to the project's tokenomics plan. The bonding curve sale will end once the 200B limit is reached, regardless of whether all tokens were sold.

## The Bottom Line

The sigmoid bonding curve is designed to reward early supporters. Every token purchase increases the price for the next buyer, creating a natural incentive to buy early.

**Key takeaways:**
- Early buyers get the best price (up to 1,666x better than late buyers)
- Price increases smoothly and predictably
- There's a hard cap: only 200B tokens will ever be sold at these prices
- Once you miss a tier, you can't go back

**Don't wait.** Every purchase makes the next one more expensive. The best time to buy PELON tokens was when the sale started. The second-best time is right now.
