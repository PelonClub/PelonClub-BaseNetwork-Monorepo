# Echidna Configuration for TokenSale Fuzzing
# This configuration file defines how Echidna will run property-based tests

# Test mode: property-based testing
testMode: property

# Number of test sequences to generate
testLimit: 50000

# Maximum number of shrink attempts
shrinkLimit: 5000

# Sequence length (number of transactions per test)
seqLen: 50

# Enable coverage analysis
coverage: true

# Output format
format: text

# Solidity compiler version
solc: "0.8.30"

# Solidity compiler optimization
# Include node_modules path for OpenZeppelin imports
# Add remappings for OpenZeppelin contracts
solcArgs: "--optimize --optimize-runs 200 --allow-paths .,/code/node_modules"
remappings:
  - "@openzeppelin/contracts/=node_modules/@openzeppelin/contracts/"

# Timeout for each test (in seconds)
timeout: 300

# Seed for random number generation (optional, for reproducibility)
# seed: 12345

# Filter functions (only test functions starting with echidna_)
# Note: Functions with arguments are treated as fuzzing functions, not properties
# filterFunctions: ["echidna_"]

# Sender addresses to use for fuzzing
sender: ["0x10000", "0x20000", "0x30000", "0x40000", "0x50000"]

# Maximum value for uint256 in fuzzing (to avoid overflow)
# Using a large but safe value for fuzzing
maxValue: 1000000000000000000000000000
